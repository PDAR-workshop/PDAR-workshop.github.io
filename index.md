## Welcome to the workshop on Parallel and Distributed Automated Reasoning 2021

In 2021, the workshop will be affiliated with [CADE-28](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mheule/CADE28/)

### Goals and Scope of Workshop

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers working on
the theory, practice, and application of parallel and distributed
automated reasoning. Whilst parallel and distributed computational
resources have become more widely abundant, and utilised in many areas
of computer science, the area of automated reasoning has not embraced
this as fully. Through this workshop we aim to provide a platform for
researchers to present and discuss solutions and challenges when
considering the parallel or distributed execution of automated
reasoners, including those from the fields of CP, SAT, SMT, ASP,
(first-order and higher-order) ATP, and CHC, including the full range of
algorithmic approaches. The aim is to create a broad forum that allows
the cross-fertilisation of ideas e.g. allowing ideas from parallel SAT
solving to inspire ATP techniques, or vice-versa.

The workshop is interested in theoretical frameworks, practical
implementations, experimental studies, and applications of parallel or
distributed reasoning. Relevant parallel or distributed approaches may
include (but are not limited to):

 - Data-parallelism supported by GPU acceleration
 - Vertical scaling on shared-memory multicore machines
 - Horizontal scaling on distributed cluster or cloud resources

### Workshop Program and Proceedings

The workshop will involve a mixture of submitted and invited talks.
Submissions will include presentation-only papers (e.g. for existing
work), position papers, and both short and full technical papers.
Submitted and invited talks will be supported by structured discussion
either as separated discussion sessions around key challenges
highlighted by talks or in the form of a panel (depending on submissions
received). A report of discussions will be included in the foreward of
the post-proceedings.

We will accept a range of submissions including invited
papers/presentations, presentation-only papers (e.g. for existing work),
position papers, short papers, and full technical papers. The focus of
the event is on discussion. We will seek to publish post-proceedings in
either CEUR or EasyChair’s Kalpa series.

#### Online plans

Depending on the COVID-19 situation the workshop will take place either
physically or on-line.  The workshop will aim to adapt an approach that
is in line with that taken by CADE-28.  Both an online and physical
version of this workshop will involve plenty of opportunity for
discussion, to identify areas of common interest.  An online version
would include an option for pre-recorded presentations.

#### Workshop history

This workshop will follow on from a range of previous workshops on
related topics.  One of the organisers was a co-chair in the workshop on
[Parallel Constraint Reasoning 2017](http://pcr17.inf.usi.ch)
