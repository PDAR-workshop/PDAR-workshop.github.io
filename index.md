## Welcome to the workshop on Parallel and Distributed Automated Reasoning 2022

In 2022, the workshop will be affiliated with [FLOC-22](https://www.floc2022.org/)

### Goals and Scope of Workshop

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers working on
the theory, practice, and application of parallel and distributed
automated reasoning. Whilst parallel and distributed computational
resources have become more widely abundant, and utilised in many areas
of computer science, the area of automated reasoning has not embraced
this as fully. Through this workshop we aim to provide a platform for
researchers to present and discuss solutions and challenges when
considering the parallel or distributed execution of automated
reasoners, including those from the fields of CP, SAT, SMT, ASP,
(first-order and higher-order) ATP, and CHC, including the full range of
algorithmic approaches. The aim is to create a broad forum that allows
the cross-fertilisation of ideas e.g. allowing ideas from parallel SAT
solving to inspire ATP techniques, or vice-versa.

The workshop is interested in theoretical frameworks, practical
implementations, experimental studies, and applications of parallel or
distributed reasoning. Relevant parallel or distributed approaches may
include (but are not limited to):

 - Data-parallelism supported by GPU acceleration
 - Vertical scaling on shared-memory multicore machines
 - Horizontal scaling on distributed cluster or cloud resources

### Workshop Program 

The workshop will feature several invited talks.

Confirmed talks (TBD):
- More To Be Confirmed

#### Workshop history

This workshop will follow on from a range of previous workshops on
related topics.  Some of the organisers previously co-chaired the workshop on
[Parallel Constraint Reasoning 2017](http://pcr17.inf.usi.ch), the workshop on [Parallel Logical Reasoning 2018](https://antonwijs.wixsite.com/plr2018) and  [Parallel Logical Reasoning 2021](https://pdar-workshop.github.io/workshop/2021).
